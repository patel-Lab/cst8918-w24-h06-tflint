# Hybrid-H06 TFLint

## Background

Building on last week's lab, you will add a linter to your Terraform project. This will help you catch errors and enforce best practices in your Terraform code. We will be using TFLint.

### What is a linter?

A linter is a tool that analyses source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. The name is derived from the name of the utility, _lint_ for the C language, which was named after the bits of fluff and dirt that collect in the fibers of clothing. Equivalent tools have been created for many other languages (e.g. ESLint for Javascript/TypeScript).

TFLint is a **static analysis tool** for Terraform modules. It checks your Terraform code for errors and best practices. This lab will guide you through the installation and configuration of TFLint and show you how to use it to improve your Terraform modules.

### Why use TFLint?

- **Consistency**: enforce best practices and coding standards across your Terraform modules.
- **Quality**: catch errors and potential issues before they become problems.
- **Security**: help avoid common security pitfalls in your infrastructure code.
- **Efficiency**: integrate linters into your CI/CD pipeline to automate code quality checks.

### Prerequisites

Fork and clone this repository to your local machine. You will need to have Terraform and Go installed. You will also need to have the Azure CLI installed and be logged in to your Azure account.

> [!TIP]
> Don't forget to run `terraform init` in the top level project folder to download the AzureRM provider plugin.

## Installation

See the [official GitHub repo README file](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for all installation options. The most common are ...

**Bash script (Linux):**

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terraform-linters/tflint/master/install_linux.sh | bash
```

**Homebrew (macOS):**

```sh
brew install tflint
```

**Chocolatey (Windows):**

```sh
choco install tflint
```

## Configuration

### Default Rule set

TFLint uses the same Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL) structure as your Terraform modules. Create a `.tflint.hcl` file with the following content.

```hcl
plugin "terraform" {
  enabled = true
  preset  = "recommended"
}
```

This enables the recommended best practice rules. The [documentation provides a quick check list](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-terraform/blob/main/docs/rules/README.md) of the rules included in the "recommended" preset and links to each rule's more detailed explanation.

To enable a more strict set of rules, change the preset in your `.tflint.hcl` to **all**.

### Rule set for the AzureRM Provider

Each of the main public cloud providers has a TFLint rule set extension for the unique features of that Terraform provider module. We need the one for the [AzureRM Provider](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-azurerm). There are over 200 rules in this rule set. Be sure to review the documentation.

Add this block to your `.tflint.hcl` file.

```hcl
plugin "azurerm" {
  enabled = true
  version = "0.25.1"
  source  = "github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-azurerm"
}
```

You can now run `tflint --init` from your project folder in the terminal to install the required rule sets.

## Test it out

Once everything is configured, you can run `tflint` in the terminal to see what it reports. Using the **recommended** preset, you should see a single warning ...

```sh
❯ tflint
1 issue(s) found:

Warning: `region` variable has no type (terraform_typed_variables)

  on variables.tf line 7:
   7: variable "region" {

Reference: https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-terraform/blob/v0.5.0/docs/rules/terraform_typed_variables.md
```

The warning message clearly identifies the error type and location. If you need further explanation of the error, follow the _Reference_ link to the ruleset documentation.

In this case, the error is that the `region` variable in `variables.tf` does not have a type. This is a best practice to ensure that the variable is used correctly in the module. The fix is to add a type to the variable definition.

```hcl
variable "region" {
  type    = string
  default = "westus3"
}
```

## Lab Tasks

1. Create a new git branch called `tflint`.
2. Change the Terraform preset from `recommended` to `all`.
3. Correct all reported issues.
4. Make sure that the **Terratest** conditions are still passing.
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Don't forget to update the _subscriptionID_ and _label_prefix_ variables in the test file.
5. Make a git commit and push your branch to GitHub.
6. Submit your GitHub repo's URL on Brightspace.
